looking to perform
    - scrubs
        - weekly? monthly?
    - snapshots
        - daily for a week
        - weekly for a month
        - monthly for 6 months or a year
    - SMART tests
        - same schedule as truenas:
            - long once a month, staggered
            - short weekly, all at once
    - notifications
        - email is easy
        - slack would be better
